# The Colonial - Exploring 157 years of Canadian Trademarks

On June 12, 1866, J.D. King & Co. registered the 
[first Trademark](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/cipo/trademark-search/0074366) 
in Canada to protect their design of "THE COLONIAL," their brand of Cuban 
cigars. Nearly 2 million trademark applications have been filed since then. 

The administration and processing of the majority of intellectual property in 
Canada is overseen by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO). 
From 2022 to 2023 they received nearly 200 trademark applications per day.

## Instructions

### Before you begin

1. Have an active [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) 
with billing enabled.
1. You've [installed Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).
1. [gcloud CLI is installed](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

### GCP Setup

1. Decide on a project name and set it as the `$PROJECT_ID` environment variable.
    ```shell copy
    export PROJECT_ID={{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}}
    echo $PROJECT_ID
    ```
1. Create a new gcloud [named configuration](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/configurations/create) 
and activate it. 
    ```shell copy
    gcloud config configuration create $PROJECT_ID
    gcloud config configurations activate $PROJECT_ID
    gcloud config set account YOUR_GCP_EMAIL
    ```
1. Create a new project.
    ```shell copy
    gcloud projects create $PROJECT_ID
    gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
    ```
    If a `WARNING` is returned, you may need to set the 
    [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) 
    quota project.

    ```shell copy
    gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project $PROJECT_ID
    ```
1. Verify the new configuration is active with the expected project and account.
    ```shell copy
    gcloud config configurations list
    ```
1. Link a billing account to the project.Ô∏è To see a list of your billing accounts, run:

    ***This command is in beta and might change without notice.*** Alternatively,
    you can enable the project's billing account using the Google Cloud Console 
    [web interface](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#how-to-enable-billing).
    ```shell copy
    gcloud beta billing accounts list
    ```

    Make note of the `ACCOUNT_ID` of the billing account you want to use from the returned output and link the project to it.
    ```shell copy
    gcloud beta billing projects link $PROJECT_ID --billing-account ACCOUNT_ID
    ```
1. Create a new service account and make note of the `EMAIL`. This will be referred to as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` in the next step.
    ```shell copy
    gcloud iam service-accounts create owner-sa --display-name="DELETE ME LATER"
    gcloud iam service-accounts list
    ```
1. Grant the `Owner` role to the service account. 

    *Note: granting basic roles in production environments is against 
    [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts), 
    so ensure that you follow the [teardown instructions]() to delete this afterwards.*

    ```shell copy
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
        --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" \
        --role="roles/owner"
    ```
1. Confirm the `Owner` service account was successfully created. 
    ```shell copy
    gcloud iam service-accounts list
    ```
1. Generate a service account key (`owner-sa-key.json`) and save it to the `/keys` project directory. 
    ```shell copy
    # Run this from the root directory of the project
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
        ./keys/owner-sa-key.json \
        --iam-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
    ```
1. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the newly created service account key. Terraform will use this later to authenticate.
    ```shell copy
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={{path_to_keyfile}}
    ```
1. Enable all the services required by the project.
    ```shell copy
    # This may take a minute to complete
    gcloud services enable \
        bigquery.googleapis.com \
        composer.googleapis.com \
        dataflow.googleapis.com \
        dataproc.googleapis.com \
        storage.googleapis.com \
        storage-component.googleapis.com
    ```
1. Add the *Cloud Composer v2 API Service Agent Extension* role required to 
manage Composer 2 environments.
    ```shell copy
    # Get current project's project number
    PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects list \
        --filter="$(gcloud config get-value project)" \
        --format="value(PROJECT_NUMBER)" \
        --limit=1)

    gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
        composer-env-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --member serviceAccount:service-$PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudcomposer-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
        --role='roles/composer.ServiceAgentV2Ext'
    ```

### Terraform Setup
Create a new file called `terraform.tfvars` in the root project directory using this template:
```hcl copy
project = "{{PROJECT_ID}}"
keyfile = "./keys/owner-sa-key.json"
```

```shell copy
terraform plan
```

This can take 20-40 minutes to complete.
```shell copy
terraform apply
```

### Teardown
1. Deprovision project related infrastructure.
    ```shell copy
    terraform destroy
    ```
1. Delete project related service accounts.

    ```shell copy
    # Owner SA
    gcloud iam service-accounts delete SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
    # Composer SA
    gcloud iam service-accounts delete composer-env-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com 
    ```
